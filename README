Regression testing is a necessary procedure of software maintenance. It aims to verify the modified part of software behaves as expected and does not affect the correctness of the unmodified part of software. Regression testing is expensive for it can take up to 50% cost of software maintenance. Regression test selection selects a subset of test cases in the original test suite to test the modified software without decreasing the ability of detecting bugs of regression testing. This technique can reduce the running time of regression testing due to reduction of original test suite. Researchers have proposed many methods of regression test selection, but there is not a practical tool for JavaScript program so far. This paper designs a regression test selection algorithm and implements a corresponding tool. The algorithm constructs relationships of function calls utilizing the cutting-edge point-to analysis, then selects a subset of test suite by comparing control flow graphs of original program and modified program and analyzing path information of test runs. The algorithm handles function calls more accurately compared with former works and can handle anonymous functions, first-class functions and some other language features. It is guaranteed that the algorithm will not discard test cases which can reveal program bugs under some restrictions of program. Experiments indicate that the tool can effectively reduce the time of regression testing of real-world programs in some condition. More work and experiments are needed if the technique is applyed to large-scale programs.
